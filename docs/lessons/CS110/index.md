### Great Ideas in Computer Architecture

- Abstraction(layers of representation/interpretation)
- Mooreâ€™s law (designing through trends)
- Make the common case fast
- Principle of locality (memory hierarchy)
- Parallelism(pipeline as a special case)
- Performance measurement & improvement
- Dependability via redundancy
